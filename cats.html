    <h1>Persion cats</h1>
    <p>
        The Persian cat (Persian: گربه پارسی, romanized: Gorbe'-ye Pârsi) is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in English-speaking countries.
         The first documented ancestors of Persian cats were imported into Italy from Persia around 1620.[1][2] Widely recognized by cat fancy since the late 19th century, Persian cats were first adopted by the English, and then mainly by American breeders after World War II. Some cat fancier organizations' breed standards subsume the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair as variants of this breed, while others treat them as separate breeds.
